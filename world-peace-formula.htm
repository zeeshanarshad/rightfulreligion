				<h3>Why are there bomb blasts and wars in the world?</h3>
				<p>Because there are various religions in the world and there are many differences among them. So the followers of all religions want to progress their religions and end other religions from the world.</p>
				<h3 dir="ltr">How can we end the differences of religions?				</h3>
				<p dir="ltr">We cannot end these religious wars and these religious differences from the world but only by establishing an international peace forum that we can research which religion is right from various religions in the world and then apply that religion in the world forever that can end differences of religions forever and then end the wars which is the reason for all problems.<br>
				</p>
				<h3>How can we stop the atomic wars and save the world from destruction?</h3>
				<p dir="ltr">It is sure that there are signs of atomic wars in the world because India is a country of Hindu religion which prepared many atom bombs, nuclear missiles and other dangerous weapons.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Because, they fear that Muslim countries, Christian countries, Jews countries and other religious countries may attack them in future. So, it is clear that India feels that all other countries are their enemies.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Similarly, the Muslim countries, Christian countries, Jews countries and all other religious countries prepared atom bombs, nuclear missiles and other dangerous weapons for the same purpose as I have said about India.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">So, it is clear that there is a sign of atomic wars among these religious countries and it is possible that these atomic wars can begin by any reason at any time among them because it is sure that everything is created to be used so there are many bombs made for use.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Suppose that if these atom bombs, nuclear missiles and other dangerous weapons will be used then what will happen in the world and what will be the condition of mankind?</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">So, it is necessary for us that we stop these atomic wars as fast as possible and the way to stop this is that we organize an international religious forum immediately to research and discuss which religion is right in the sight of God who created this universe.</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">Because, when mankind will obey only one religion then the differences of religions will end.				</p>
			  <h3>What are the disadvantages of atomic wars?</h3>
				<p dir="ltr">It is obvious to every person who has the right knowledge and wisdom that disadvantages of atomic wars are out of thought.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Sometimes, we can study the condition of Hiroshima and we can see disadvantages of the atom bomb there.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">We cannot explain how much money has been spent in preparation of atomic bombs and other dangerous weapons, and how much money is being spent to save these bombs.<br>
				</p>
				<h3 dir="ltr">What are the conditions of mankind in the world at this time?				</h3>
				<p dir="ltr">The condition of mankind in the world is extremely bad because they do not have enough food to eat, fresh water for drink, useful clothes for wearing, houses for living, medicines for illness especially in rural and urban areas of all countries in the world. I think the solution to these problems is only money but governments have no money left to spend on these problems.</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">Because, they are compulsively spending approx. 75% money on atom bombs and weapons for defense of their countries in the situation of religious wars.</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">I think that if the religious differences end and establish only one true religion to the God in the world then this money will be saved for humanity and their problems that have been described above will be solved easily.				</p>
			  <h3>Do we need to change the map of the world?</h3>
				<p>No, absolutely no! We don&rsquo;t need to change the map of the world, and all countries will remain the same in the present condition and the public will choose their governors in their countries for republic government.</p>
				<h2 align="center" class="text-success">World Peace Formula Forever</h2>
				<h3 dir="ltr">The condition of mankind in the world:				</h3>
				<p dir="ltr">According to my research the condition of mankind in villages areas is that 70% mankind Muslims and Non-Muslims are living in poverty and necessity that they do not have houses for living, suitable foods for eating, fresh water for drinking, necessary clothes for wearing, money for treatment of illness and education for their children and there are also many educated and uneducated people in cities without jobs or services. When you talk to governments of Muslims and Non-Muslims of the world to solve the problems of these people, they say that they do not have enough money to spend on their peoples' needs.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">The reality is that they say this because they are spending 70% money from their income to defend their country by fear of circumstances that other enemy countries may attack on them.</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">The quantity of atom bombs, missiles and modern weapons in the world:</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">The reality is that there are many atom bombs, missiles and modern weapons that can destroy the whole world about 10 times. According to my research, all mankind in the beginning are from one father and one mother Adam and his Wife Hawwa (Peace Be Upon Him). Though, we call them Jews, Hindus, Christians and Muslims due to differences of religions. So all mankind by this way are brothers and sisters among them. But it is sad that instead they should live among them with love and unity. They are enemies to each other. Is it not amazing that they have prepared atom bombs, missiles and other dangerous weapons to end each other from the world?				</p>
			  <h3>World Peace Formula:</h3>
				<p dir="ltr">According to my thinking and research, the reason for all of the above conditions is that there are major differences in all religions of the world.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Due to this reason, there were many religious wars in the past and these religious wars and bomb blasts continue underground until now. But if I say that these religious wars will remain the same and continue in the future in the world and the world is going to be destroyed, it will not be wrong.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">I have the world peace formula forever that we should establish only one religion in the whole world which is surely true and lovely near the creator of this universe and we should cancel all other religions.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Because, the purpose of a religion is to be a source of knowing the way for worshiping and obeying to God.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">It is perfect near to all religions that the creator of this universe is only one whose name is Allah in Arabic language, God in English language, Khuda in Persian language and Bhagwan in Hindi language. So the true religion at a time near to God should be only one.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">It is impossible that at a time the creator of this universe has permitted many different religions to guide mankind the way of his worship and let the followers of different religions become enemies for each other and start the atomic war to finish each other from the world for the pleasure of their God.</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">So we all mankind should research that which religion is only one and true near to the creator Allah that we can establish in the world and save the money which we spend on atom bombs, missiles and dangerous weapons and use this money on the mankind who are not able to complete their basic necessities.</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">By this way, we can live on the Earth with love and unity. I do not advise mankind to change the map of the world, but I say to establish only one religion in the world and all countries will remain the same as they are in the present condition. The people of all countries will choose their governors by their votes as it is in republic countries and the army, police and courts will remain active to solve minor differences and quarrel among them.				</p>
			  <h3>An appeal to all mankind of the world:</h3>
				<p dir="ltr">In last, I request to the mankind of the world that if you agree with my document then please support us, discuss with us so that we can search a true religion and establish it in the whole world otherwise the mankind of the world cannot establish peace in the world forever and cannot stop the bomb blasts and religious atomic wars in future, and they cannot solve the problems of 70% poor mankind but only by the establishment of one religion in the world from various religions.</p>
			  <p dir="ltr">I hope that the mankind of the world will give attention to my &quot;world peace formula&quot; before the atomic religious war begins. Without ending the differences of religions and establishing the only one rightful religion, I have no second peace formula for establishment of peace in the world.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Join us and discuss this issue. May Allah Almighty give common sense and right guidance to sons and daughters of first man Adam and first lady Hawwa (Peace Be Upon Him) that they will be able to serve the creator Allah and may Allah guide us to his true and lovely religion.</p>
				<h3>An Announcement:</h3>
				<p>I request to readers of this peace formula that if you agree to this and you think that it will be useful for other Muslim and Non-Muslim brothers and sisters if they read it, then copy or print it and spread in people for pleasure of your Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), his family, his companions and your relatives.</p>
