			<h2 class="mb-5 shadow-sm p-3 mb-5 bg-body rounded" id="power">The Miraculous Soul of Islam</h2>
			<p>For those who may have doubts about the miraculous healing through Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba, we understand your skepticism. However, it is important to note that the ability to cure the incurable is a reality based on the teachings of Islam and the command of Allah. While some may claim that there are devils on the shrine of Shah Yaqeeq Baba who perform these miracles, it begs the question: why don't these devils do the same healing and medical operations on other shrines or for non-Muslims?</p>
			<p>To those who may view this as fake or scam, we urge you to consider the reality of Islam and the power of Allah. It is by the Will of Allah that Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba performing medical treatment and surgeries like a real physical doctor while in fact he is a Muslim Martyr who was slain 500 years ago. No soul of any dead non-Muslim is able to do it and will never be able to do it ever as well because there is no God except ALLAH the Almighty Glorious Holy King of Universe.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fubk6cG2S3Q">Watch this interview</a> by Moulana Abrar Alam on shrine of Shah Yaqeeq Baba with a person whose daughters were cured by the Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba. 
You may wonder why mainstream media outside of Pakistan do not widely report on Shah Yaqeeq Baba? If you carefully observe and think wisely then you can realize that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/urdu/pakistan/2009/06/090603_surgeon_baba_zee.shtml">BBC Urdu</a>, a British broadcasting company founded by the UK government, has already reported on the miracles of Shah Yaqeeq Baba. Therefore, we encourage you to use your common sense too and accept the clear proofs and extraordinary evidences presented by us along with official media news channel reports of Pakistan.</p>
			<p>As for why international Muslim scholars do not much talk about Shah Yaqeeq Baba in English language? You should know that graves and shrines are extremely and very serious controversial topics among most Muslim scholars of the world threrefore they consider the Shrine of Shah Yaqeeq Baba as a place of "grave worship" thus as a result they do not promote and do not support our research on fresh dead bodies on <a href="life-after-death.htm">life after death</a> because Shaitan has captured their mindset and don't let them think wisely the depth and power of these miracles of Allah.</p>
			<p>No soul of any non-Muslim on earth can ever perform spiritual healing and surgeries of incurable patients like the Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba is doing by the Will &amp; Permission of Allah so wise people will surely accept it and intransigent will remain arrogant and disbeliever because they don't use their common sense, brain, logic and science. </p>
			<p>The Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba is a clear and absolute sign on truth of religion Islam in the 21st century of modern science &amp; technology.</p>

			<ol>
			  <li>
			    <p>Do you only accept news that aligns with your beliefs and reject news that doesn't fit your worldview? Are you open to considering information that challenges your beliefs?</p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>If you believe that souls do not exist, who or what is responsible for the miraculous healing and medical treatments that occur at the shrine of Shah Yaqeeq Baba?</p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>Have you heard of any cases where a dead non-Muslim has performed medical treatments or operations on incurable patients? If not, why do you think this is the case?</p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>If it is not possible for the soul of a dead non-Muslim to perform surgeries on incurable patients, then how do you explain the healing powers of the Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba?</p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>If you do not believe in Allah as the one true God, then how do you explain the ability of the Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba to cure incurable diseases?</p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>If Allah is not a real God, then how do you explain the healing powers of the Soul of Shah Yaqeeq Baba? Who or what gave this ability to his Soul?</p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>If worshippers of false gods possess spiritual powers for healing, why do we not see evidence of such healing on their shrines or graves or samadhi once they have died? And who diminished their all spiritual powers? And why have they become so powerless in a sudden?</p>
